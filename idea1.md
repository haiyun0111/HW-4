Minesweeper
  Minesweeper is a game that has a long history. It's easy but also hard at the same time. Easy because it looks simple 
  and operate simple , hard because it will require the players to have the ability to calculate the number. 
  The rule is like this: players need to find all the bombs in the game. If you accidently click the wrong one, which means
  the bomb then the game is over. Each game will set about ten percent of the bomb. Which means, if you have 99 squares on 
  the screen, the bomb number is 10. Number one means there is one bomb around it, it can be top, button, left, right, 
  top right, top left, bottom left and the bottom right.  
I am going to use the square and circle to set the scene. I do not plan to design the random bombs. So the player can 
only play the same game over and over again.
