The tap
Tap
I will set the scene of water coming from the tap and drop to the sink. If the player clicks the switch button. 
Then the blue water will come out from the tap. Then, the water will fill out the sink, slowly coming out of the sink. 
I will also design a tube, if the player click the tube button, then the water will slowly go down and run into the tube. 
I am going to use the same idea of the lawndrawer, using the mouseIsPressed and the sound. This can be a fun program if 
it can be successfully run.
